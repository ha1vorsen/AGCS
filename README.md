<b>Aeon Genesis Cave Story+ Translation  (Switch)</b>

This is a drop-in atmosphere modification for Cave Story+ on the Nintendo Switch that restores the first major translation project for Cave Story. <br>
If you are using a Japanese version of the game, please be sure to fix the data for your specific version by moving the data folder to the other TitleID folder. <br>
Each TitleID folder will be labelled per region.
<br>
<br>
The latest 1.12 version is fully compatible with the v1.3 update of Cave Story+ and no longer has the game-breaking bug from Grasstown in the Malco room.
